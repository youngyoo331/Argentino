            <p>Why Choose Dogos for your next Dogo Argentino?
                The universe has given us three things to make life bearable - hope, jokes, and dogs. The most precious of all is dogs. A Dogo Argentino from Dream Dogos makes that saying absolutely true.
                I started my breeding program in 2008. I made a special effort to get bloodlines from the best kennels in the United states, Argentina, Brazil and Europe. I have selectively bred the best traits regarding physical appearance, temperament and breed standard in each bloodline until I have created Dream Dogos Bloodlines. You can clearly see the difference in this picture. These are two female dogos of the exact same age at 6 months. The Dogo on the left is imported from a very famous kennel in Argentina and the Dogo on the right is Dream Dogos bloodlines. It breaks my heart when I get a phone call from a dogo argentino owner saying that he or she got a dogo from this or that place and they do not think that it is a dogo. I am offering you the result of 14 years of selective breeding that incorporated the best qualities and removed all the defects in each bloodline you can possibly imagine.</p>

            <h3>Is Dogo Argentino friendly with other dogs?</h3>
            <p>Generally, the Dogo Argentino is not very cordial and kind to other canines. This pooch has a hard time trusting other dogs and it mostly remains fairly reserved and quiet around them. Untrained Dogos can also be very aggressive with strange canines especially if they are of the same gender, hence proper training and guidance are extremely important for this pooch so that it can be a bit more amiable and pleasant with other dogs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>Does a Dogo Argentino make good guard Dog?</h3>
            <p>Yes! A Dogo Argentino can be a great guard dog for most families. This pooch has really good protective instincts and it can defend its loved ones against most kinds of harms and dangers. It is also a pretty decent watchdog. It can effectively alert its housemates through its bark in case of a trespasser, intruder or a burglar.</p>

                        <p>Staff is great to work with and eager to find the puppies a forever home. The financing is great and several different options to choose from. The two puppies we bought which we purchased a year apart, were great. The fist puppy had a little cold but the vet took care of all the puppies needs. The second puppy was healthy and good to go. Definitely recommend!</p>
